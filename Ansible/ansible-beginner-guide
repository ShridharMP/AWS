ssh-copy-id ip-address --.it is to connect to targetor slave node but this command don't have enough permission to do some activity 
as we wanted.
create 2EC2 instances --> (master and slave) or (source and target).
mkdir ansible.
sudo apt update.
sudo apt install ansible.
ansible --version.
Create inventory file in ansible folder.
Add target EC2 instance private IP address in inventory file.
Connect with master ec2 instance with target ec2 intance using password less authentication.
cd ansible.
ssh-keygen  (this cmd will generate 3files namely authorized-keys,ida-rsa(private key) ,ida-rsa.pub key (public key).
add public key of master or source node ec2 instance in target or slave node of ec2 instance.
Connect to target node from master node using the (ssh ip-address of target) ex: ssh 172.31.91.104
Once connection is successfull we can give commands to target node from master node by creating ansible playbook or ansible adhoc commands

cd ansible
vim inventory
ansible -i inventory all -m "shell" -a "touch devopsclass"

***********************************************************************
playbook is nothing but Ansible file
everytime no need to write playbook for small task for that use adhoc commands 
fallow below link to write shell script or playbook or ansible file --shell â€“ Execute shell commands on targets
(https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/list_of_all_modules.html)
Examples:
        ansible -i inventory all -m "shell" -a "touch devopsclass"
        ansible -i inventory all -m "shell" -a "ls -ltr"
        ansible -i inventory all -m "shell" -a "df"
        ansible -i inventory all -m "shell" -a "nproc"
