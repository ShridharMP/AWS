Create inventory file in ansible folder.
Add target EC2 instance private IP address in inventory file.
Connect with master ec2 instance with target ec2 intance using password less authentication.
cd ansible.
ssh-keygen  (this cmd will generate 3files namely authorized-keys,ida-rsa(private key) ,ida-rsa.pub key (public key).
add public key of master or source node ec2 instance in target or slave node of ec2 instance.
Connect to target node from master node using the (ssh ip-address of target) ex: ssh 172.31.91.104
